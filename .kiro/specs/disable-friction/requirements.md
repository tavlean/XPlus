# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds intentional friction to the process of disabling the "Home Redirect" functionality in the Xtab browser extension. The goal is to encourage users to maintain their focus and productivity by making it slightly more difficult to turn off the redirect-to-bookmarks feature, while still preserving user autonomy and choice.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a productivity-focused user, I want the extension to gently discourage me from disabling the home redirect feature, so that I maintain my focus habits even during moments of weakness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to disable the home redirect toggle THEN the system SHALL present a confirmation dialog before proceeding
2. WHEN the confirmation dialog appears THEN the system SHALL include a brief reminder of the productivity benefits
3. WHEN a user confirms they want to disable the feature THEN the system SHALL require a short delay (3-5 seconds) before the change takes effect
4. WHEN the delay period is active THEN the system SHALL display a countdown timer with an option to cancel

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user who occasionally needs to disable the feature temporarily, I want a "snooze" option that automatically re-enables the feature after a set time, so that I don't forget to turn it back on.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user chooses to disable the home redirect THEN the system SHALL offer snooze options (15 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours, until tomorrow)
2. WHEN a user selects a snooze option THEN the system SHALL automatically re-enable the feature after the specified time
3. WHEN a snooze period is active THEN the system SHALL display the remaining time in the popup interface
4. WHEN a snooze period expires THEN the system SHALL show a brief notification that the feature has been re-enabled

<!-- ### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user who wants to permanently disable the feature, I want to provide a reason for my decision, so that the extension can learn from user feedback and I can reflect on my choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user chooses permanent disable over snooze options THEN the system SHALL present a feedback form with common reasons
2. WHEN the feedback form is displayed THEN the system SHALL include options like "Too intrusive", "Prefer manual navigation", "Technical issues", and "Other"
3. WHEN "Other" is selected THEN the system SHALL provide a text field for custom feedback
4. WHEN feedback is submitted THEN the system SHALL store it locally for potential future analysis
5. WHEN feedback is provided THEN the system SHALL proceed with the permanent disable after a 5-second reflection period -->

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user who has disabled the feature, I want gentle reminders about re-enabling it, so that I can reconsider my decision periodically without being annoyed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the home redirect feature has been disabled for 24 hours THEN the system SHALL show a subtle badge or indicator in the popup
2. WHEN the feature has been disabled for 7 days THEN the system SHALL show a gentle re-engagement message once per week
3. WHEN a re-engagement message is shown THEN the system SHALL include a one-click re-enable option
4. WHEN a user dismisses re-engagement messages 3 times THEN the system SHALL stop showing them for 30 days

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the settings interface to clearly separate basic utility features from focus-oriented features, so that I can easily understand which settings affect my productivity habits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the popup interface loads THEN the system SHALL display settings in two distinct sections: "Utility Features" and "Focus Features"
2. WHEN the sections are displayed THEN the system SHALL use visual separators and different styling to distinguish between them
3. WHEN utility features are shown THEN the system SHALL include Posts and Notifications toggles with standard toggle behavior
4. WHEN focus features are shown THEN the system SHALL include Home Redirect with enhanced friction mechanisms
5. WHEN the interface is rendered THEN the system SHALL use improved visual design with better spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the popup interface to be visually appealing and well-organized, so that I enjoy interacting with the extension settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the popup opens THEN the system SHALL display a modern, clean interface with improved visual design
2. WHEN sections are rendered THEN the system SHALL use appropriate icons, colors, and spacing to enhance readability
3. WHEN focus features are displayed THEN the system SHALL use visual cues (colors, icons) to indicate their special nature
4. WHEN hover states occur THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions and visual feedback
5. WHEN the interface is viewed THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency with modern browser extension design patterns

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the friction mechanisms to be respectful of my time and choices, so that I don't feel manipulated or frustrated by the extension.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any friction mechanism is presented THEN the system SHALL provide clear options to proceed or cancel
2. WHEN delays are implemented THEN the system SHALL never exceed 5 seconds for any single step
3. WHEN confirmation dialogs appear THEN the system SHALL use respectful, non-judgmental language
4. WHEN a user has gone through the full disable process THEN the system SHALL respect their choice without additional barriers
5. IF a user disables and re-enables the feature multiple times in a day THEN the system SHALL reduce friction on subsequent attempts
