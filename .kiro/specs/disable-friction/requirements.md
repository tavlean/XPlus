# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds intentional friction to the process of disabling the "Home Redirect" functionality in the XPlus browser extension. The goal is to encourage users to maintain their focus and productivity by making it slightly more difficult to turn off the redirect-to-bookmarks feature, while still preserving user autonomy and choice.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a productivity-focused user, I want the extension to gently discourage me from disabling the home redirect feature, so that I maintain my focus habits even during moments of weakness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to disable the home redirect toggle THEN the system SHALL present a confirmation dialog before proceeding
2. WHEN the confirmation dialog appears THEN the system SHALL include a brief reminder of the productivity benefits
3. WHEN a user confirms they want to disable the feature THEN the system SHALL require a short delay (3-5 seconds) before the change takes effect
4. WHEN the delay period is active THEN the system SHALL display a countdown timer with an option to cancel

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user who occasionally needs to disable the feature temporarily, I want a "snooze" option that automatically re-enables the feature after a set time, so that I don't forget to turn it back on.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user chooses to disable the home redirect THEN the system SHALL offer snooze options (15 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours, until tomorrow)
2. WHEN a user selects a snooze option THEN the system SHALL automatically re-enable the feature after the specified time
3. WHEN a snooze period is active THEN the system SHALL display the remaining time in the popup interface
4. WHEN a snooze period expires THEN the system SHALL show a brief notification that the feature has been re-enabled

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user who has disabled the feature, I want gentle reminders about re-enabling it, so that I can reconsider my decision periodically without being annoyed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the home redirect feature has been disabled for 24 hours THEN the system SHALL show a subtle badge or indicator in the popup
2. WHEN the feature has been disabled for 7 days THEN the system SHALL show a gentle re-engagement message once per week
3. WHEN a re-engagement message is shown THEN the system SHALL include a one-click re-enable option
4. WHEN a user dismisses re-engagement messages 3 times THEN the system SHALL stop showing them for 30 days

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the settings interface to clearly separate basic utility features from focus-oriented features, so that I can easily understand which settings affect my productivity habits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the popup interface loads THEN the system SHALL display settings in two distinct sections: "Focus Features" at the top and "Utility Features" at the bottom
2. WHEN the sections are displayed THEN the system SHALL use visual separators and different styling to distinguish between them
3. WHEN utility features are shown THEN the system SHALL include Posts and Notifications toggles with standard toggle behavior
4. WHEN focus features are shown THEN the system SHALL include Home Redirect and Explore Redirect with enhanced friction mechanisms
5. WHEN the interface is rendered THEN the system SHALL use improved visual design with better spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the popup interface to be visually appealing and well-organized, so that I enjoy interacting with the extension settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the popup opens THEN the system SHALL display a modern, clean interface with improved visual design
2. WHEN sections are rendered THEN the system SHALL use appropriate icons, colors, and spacing to enhance readability
3. WHEN focus features are displayed THEN the system SHALL use visual cues (colors, icons) to indicate their special nature
4. WHEN hover states occur THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions and visual feedback
5. WHEN the interface is viewed THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency with modern browser extension design patterns

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the friction mechanisms to be respectful of my time and choices, so that I don't feel manipulated or frustrated by the extension.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any friction mechanism is presented THEN the system SHALL provide clear options to proceed or cancel
2. WHEN delays are implemented THEN the system SHALL never exceed 5 seconds for any single step
3. WHEN confirmation dialogs appear THEN the system SHALL use respectful, non-judgmental language
4. WHEN a user has gone through the full disable process THEN the system SHALL respect their choice without additional barriers
5. IF a user disables and re-enables the feature multiple times in a day THEN the system SHALL reduce friction on subsequent attempts

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a productivity-focused user, I want to redirect explore pages (/explore and all sub-paths) to bookmarks, so that I avoid getting distracted by trending content and discovery feeds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to any /explore path (including /explore/tabs/trending, /explore/tabs/sports, etc.) THEN the system SHALL redirect to the bookmarks page if Explore Redirect is enabled
2. WHEN the Explore Redirect toggle is enabled THEN the system SHALL apply the same friction mechanisms as Home Redirect when attempting to disable
3. WHEN a user attempts to disable Explore Redirect THEN the system SHALL present the same confirmation dialog, snooze options, and countdown as Home Redirect
4. WHEN both Home Redirect and Explore Redirect are enabled THEN the system SHALL handle them independently with separate snooze timers if needed
5. WHEN the Explore Redirect feature is displayed THEN the system SHALL use the same visual styling as other focus features

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want improved interaction design in the settings interface, so that the extension feels more polished and intuitive to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I hover over setting options THEN the system SHALL NOT cause visual movement or shifting of elements
2. WHEN I click anywhere on a setting option element THEN the system SHALL toggle that setting (not just when clicking the toggle switch)
3. Use normal colors instead of bright yellow for focus feature settings in main popup
4. WHEN the snooze dialog shows the "Keep Enabled" button THEN the system SHALL style it with green color to encourage positive action
5. WHEN hover states are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain stable positioning and smooth transitions
6. Add the extesion's icon on the left of H1 in popup
