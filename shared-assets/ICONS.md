# Extension Icons

Place the following icon files in this directory:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels icon
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels icon
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels icon

These icons will be used across all browser extensions during the build process.

## Guidelines

- Use PNG format with transparency
- Keep file sizes optimized
- Ensure icons are recognizable at smaller sizes
- Follow browser extension store guidelines for each platform

During the build process, these shared icons will be automatically copied to each browser-specific directory.
